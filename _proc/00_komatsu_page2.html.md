title: Layout Creation

---


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

We define the configuration of the page layout as follows , in a way we are telling the pixel density of the page wit the following 

Some constants related to the creation of a page are as follows 

## Utility functions

Manim library accepts its coordinate values in a system that points its origin to the center of the page, we have to convert it to the top left orgin system, we use the following method for that purpose 

---

[source](https://github.com/alix559/ocr_developer_kit/blob/main/ocr_developer_kit/komatsu.py#L35){target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller"}

### paint_pixels

>      paint_pixels (px, axis='x', system='manim')

*provide the distance value in pixels , the axis (x or y)*


Similarly to place a text character or word  in the top left coordinate system we have the following method

---

[source](https://github.com/alix559/ocr_developer_kit/blob/main/ocr_developer_kit/komatsu.py#L54){target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller"}

### place_text_paint

>      place_text_paint (text, px, py, font_size=24,
>                        color=ManimColor('#000000'), weight='NORMAL',
>                        anchor=array([-1.,  1.,  0.]), line_spacing=1.2,
>                        **kwargs)


To draw a  straight line from a point a to b

### make_line_paint

>      make_line_paint (start_px, end_px, color=ManimColor('#000000'),
>                       stroke_width=42, system='manim')

*provide the start point, end point and the axis(x or y ) that you want to draw the straight line in.*


The following is a slightly complicated method used for generating the line items

### create_item_group

>      create_item_group (item, item_number, row_x, row_y, row_width,
>                         row_height, draw_rect=False)


The invoice headers are generated using the following

### generate_header_specs_from_invoice

>      generate_header_specs_from_invoice (invoice, frame_number=0)


## Main Scene class

### InvoiceScene

>      InvoiceScene (frame_number=0, **kwargs)

*A Scene is the canvas of your animation.

The primary role of :class:`Scene` is to provide the user with tools to manage
mobjects and animations.  Generally speaking, a manim script consists of a class
that derives from :class:`Scene` whose :meth:`Scene.construct` method is overridden
by the user's code.

Mobjects are displayed on screen by calling :meth:`Scene.add` and removed from
screen by calling :meth:`Scene.remove`.  All mobjects currently on screen are kept
in :attr:`Scene.mobjects`.  Animations are played by calling :meth:`Scene.play`.

A :class:`Scene` is rendered internally by calling :meth:`Scene.render`.  This in
turn calls :meth:`Scene.setup`, :meth:`Scene.construct`, and
:meth:`Scene.tear_down`, in that order.

It is not recommended to override the ``__init__`` method in user Scenes.  For code
that should be ran before a Scene is rendered, use :meth:`Scene.setup` instead.*

|    | **Type** | **Default** | **Details** |

| frame_number | int | 0 | Add frame_number parameter |

### load_json_data_source

>      load_json_data_source (data_source_path=None, data_source_url=None)

*Load JSON data from various sources.

Args:
    data_source_path (str, optional): Path to local JSON file
    data_source_url (str, optional): URL to remote JSON endpoint

Returns:
    dict/list: Loaded JSON data

Raises:
    FileNotFoundError: If local file doesn't exist
    requests.RequestException: If remote request fails
    json.JSONDecodeError: If JSON parsing fails*
